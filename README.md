# Ambient Temperature and Humidity 

The motivation for this project is to provide a tool for 
people in electronics manufacturing or any other field who 
are interested in the ambient temperature and humidity of the 
room in which raw materials are stored in. At my current 
place of employment, it is important that we capture the 
ambient temperature and humidity of the room in which experiments
are being conducted in, and where raw materials are stored in 
because we want the materials to stay free of any moisture and 
not absorb moisture from the air.

In this project I will be using a DHT22 Temperature and Humidity
Sensor Module and a Raspberry Pi 4. The purpose of the project is to 
use the Raspberry Pi to draw data from the sensor and display it
clearly on a web server or external display connected to the 
Raspberry Pi as well. A web server can be hosted using Flask and 
hosted on a local server for the user. Using Python and HTML
a code can be scripted to provide instructions to the Raspberry 
Pi to collect data from the sensor module and display it on 
a live updating web server. Using this product any person
can be able to quickly receive an accurate reading of the 
ambient temperature and humidity for experimental logging 
or storage quality check.
